# CrashGenie: Intelligent Accident Hotspot Detection and Response Enhancement 

## Overview

This project aims to enhance road safety and emergency response efficiency by predicting accident hotspots and optimizing response strategies using Big Data technologies. By analyzing extensive datasets related to motor vehicle crashes, traffic events, and weather conditions, the project seeks to identify high-risk areas for accidents and improve emergency response times.

## Project Details

- **Objective:** Develop predictive models to identify potential accident hotspots and optimize emergency response based on historical data.
- **Approach:**
  - **Data Integration:** Combine datasets covering various aspects of motor vehicle crashes, traffic conditions, and weather events.
  - **Predictive Modeling:** Utilize machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest for predicting accident hotspots and KNN for optimizing emergency response times.

## Datasets

1. **Motor-Vehicle Crash Dataset**
   - **Description:** Contains records of motor vehicle accidents across 49 states in the US, with data collected continuously from February 2016. The dataset includes 1.5 million records with attributes such as location, time, weather conditions, and nearby points of interest.
